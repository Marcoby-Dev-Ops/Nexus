Yes, the database is fully set up to handle assessment responses and scoring.

Here's a summary of what's in place:

1.  **Storage Tables**:
    *   `AssessmentQuestion`: Stores the questions, their types (`multiple-choice`, `text`, etc.), and what category they belong to.
    *   `AssessmentCategory`: Defines the categories for the questions and includes a `weight` for calculating weighted scores.
    *   `AssessmentResponse`: This is where each response from a user is stored. Crucially, it has a `value` field for the answer itself and a `score` field to hold the calculated score for that specific answer.

2.  **Scoring and Summary Tables**:
    *   `AssessmentCategoryScore`: This table holds the aggregated score for each category, for each company.
    *   `AssessmentSummary`: This table stores the final, overall assessment score for a company.

3.  **Automatic Scoring Logic**:
    *   There's a database function that automatically recalculates the category and overall scores every time an assessment response is added, updated, or deleted. This ensures the scores are always up-to-date.

So, when a user submits an assessment, the responses are saved, immediately scored, and the overall and category-specific scores are updated automatically.
