# üéØ Issue Resolution Summary

## ‚úÖ **Problems Identified and Fixed**

### **1. Import Error**
- **Issue**: `CompanyProvisioningOptions` export error in Vite
- **Fix**: Separated runtime imports from type imports
- **Solution**: 
  ```typescript
  import { companyProvisioningService } from '@/core/services/CompanyProvisioningService';
  import type { CompanyProvisioningOptions, ProvisioningResult } from '@/core/services/CompanyProvisioningService';
  ```

### **2. Database Schema Mismatch**
- **Issue**: `CompanyProvisioningService` was using non-existent columns (`ownerid`, `createdat`, `updatedat`)
- **Fix**: Updated to use correct column names (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `src/core/services/CompanyProvisioningService.ts`
  - `src/core/services/userProfileService.ts`

### **3. Missing Company Association**
- **Issue**: User had `company_id = null` in their profile
- **Fix**: Associated user with existing company and created business profile
- **Database Changes**:
  - Updated `user_profiles.company_id` to `'86377f73-5163-4d7e-a1a7-773e11045fc3'`
  - Updated `user_profiles.role` to `'owner'`
  - Created business profile for the company

-- Company should exist
SELECT id, name, industry, size FROM companies WHERE id = '86377f73-5163-4d7e-a1a7-773e11045fc3';
