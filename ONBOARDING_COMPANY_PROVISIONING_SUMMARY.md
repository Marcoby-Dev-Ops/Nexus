src/shared/components/layout/AppWithOnboarding.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Added company provisioning imports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Enhanced BasicInfoStep with company creation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Added loading states and error handling

```

#### **Key Features:**

- **User-Friendly Loading**: Clear feedback during company creation
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of provisioning failures
- **Completion Verification**: Ensures company association after onboarding

## üß™ **How to Test**

### **Method 1: Force Onboarding Mode**
1. **Open the app**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Force onboarding**: Add `?force-onboarding=true` to the URL
3. **Complete onboarding**: Go through the onboarding steps
4. **Check console**: Look for company creation logs
5. **Verify database**: Check Supabase for new company and user association

### **Method 2: Browser Console Testing**
1. **Open browser console**: F12 ‚Üí Console
2. **Load test script**: Copy and paste the test script
3. **Run tests**: Execute `testOnboardingFlow()` or `testCompanyProvisioning()`

### **Method 3: Manual Verification**
1. **Complete onboarding**: Go through the full onboarding flow
2. **Check logs**: Look for these console messages:
   ```
   [BasicInfoStep] Company created successfully: {companyId}
   [AppWithOnboarding] Company association ensured after onboarding
   ```
3. **Verify database**: Check Supabase tables:
   - `companies` - Should have new company record
   - `user_profiles` - Should have `company_id` populated

## üîç **Expected Behavior**

### **During Onboarding:**
1. **Step 1 (Basic Info)**: Company is created automatically when user clicks "Continue"
2. **Loading State**: Button shows "Setting up..." during company creation
3. **Success**: Company created and user associated
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if company creation fails

### **After Onboarding:**
1. **Company Association**: User has a `company_id` in their profile
2. **Database Access**: No more 403 errors when accessing business data
3. **App Functionality**: All features work normally with company context

## üìä **Database Verification**

### **Check These Tables:**
```sql
-- Check if company was created
SELECT * FROM companies WHERE ownerid = 'your-user-id';

-- Check if user profile has company_id
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check business profile association
SELECT * FROM business_profiles WHERE org_id = 'company-id';
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Company record exists with proper name and settings
- ‚úÖ User profile has `company_id` populated
- ‚úÖ Business profile associated with company
- ‚úÖ No 403 errors when accessing business data

## üöÄ **Benefits Achieved**

### **1. No More Errors**
- ‚ùå **Before**: "User not associated with a company" 403 errors
- ‚úÖ **After**: Automatic company provisioning with graceful fallbacks

### **2. Better User Experience**
- **Seamless Onboarding**: Users can start using the app immediately
- **Multiple Options**: Personal workspace, company workspace, or guided setup
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, upgrade later

### **3. Salesforce-Style Flexibility**

- **Team Use**: Like Salesforce's company orgs
- **Guided Setup**: Like Salesforce's guided setup wizards

### **4. Developer-Friendly**
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: No need to handle company errors everywhere
- **Configurable Options**: Different strategies for different use cases
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of provisioning actions

## üîß **Technical Details**

### **Company Creation Strategies**

#### **Default Company (Onboarding)**
```typescript
{
  name: "John Doe's Company",
  industry: "Technology",
  size: "1-10",
  description: "Personal company created automatically",
  ownerid: userId
}
```

#### **Personal Workspace (Fallback)**
```typescript
{
  name: "John Doe's Workspace",
  industry: "Personal",
  size: "1",
  description: "Personal workspace",
  ownerid: userId
}
```

### **Error Handling**
```typescript
// Instead of throwing errors:
return { data: null, error: 'User not associated with a company' };

// Now provides graceful fallbacks:
const { companyId, error } = await companyProvisioningService.getOrCreateCompany(userId);
if (companyId) {
  // Continue with business logic
} else {
  // Provide user-friendly error message
  return { data: null, error: 'Unable to access business data - company setup required' };
}
```

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the Implementation**: Use the testing methods above
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track which provisioning options users prefer
3. **Enhance Options**: Add more company templates and setup flows
4. **Analytics**: Track provisioning success rates and user satisfaction

## üîç **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Logs to Watch**
```typescript
// Successful provisioning
logger.info(`Created default company "${companyName}" for user ${userId}`);

// Failed provisioning
logger.warn('Failed to provision company for user:', provisioningError);

// Automatic retries
logger.info('Company provisioned successfully, retrying business data fetch');
```

### **Metrics to Track**
- Provisioning success rate
- User preference for different options
- Time to first successful data access
- Error reduction in company-related issues
