# TODO

## Completed âœ…

- [x] **debug-identity-setup** - Debug Identity setup showing 'Not Set Up' despite completed onboarding
- [x] **check-organization-id** - Check why organization_id is undefined in user profile  
- [x] **fix-organization-link** - Added fallback to use organization store data when profile organization_id is missing
- [x] **fix-quantum-table** - Added quantum_business_profiles to allowed tables (partial fix)
- [x] **fix-quantum-onboarding** - Re-enabled quantum onboarding flow and profile saving

## Resolved (No Action Needed) ðŸ”„

- [x] **fix-ensure-user-profile** - ~~Update ensure_user_profile database function to properly set organization_id~~ 
  - **Status**: Resolved via client-side fallback approach
  - **Reason**: The application now works correctly using organization store data as fallback when profile.organization_id is missing. This is a simpler, more reliable solution than modifying the database function.

## Current Status

The quantum dashboard is now working correctly:
- âœ… Organization access works through simple fallback logic
- âœ… Quantum onboarding flow is re-enabled and functional  
- âœ… Profile creation and saving works properly
- âœ… "Not Set Up" issue resolved - dashboard shows correct state based on profile existence

The application uses the simplest, most reliable solution without heavy functions as requested.
