# ðŸš€ Nexus Ultimate Prompt Library (Build-From-Scratch Edition)

---

## Universal Department Structure: THINK â†’ SEE â†’ ACT

Every department module in Nexus now follows a universal structure to maximize clarity, enablement, and action:

- **Analysis (THINK):** Automated and on-demand analysis of department performance, trends, and diagnostics. (KPIs, charts, summaries)
- **Advice (SEE):** AI-powered recommendations, prioritized actions, and strategic guidance. (Next Best Actions, improvement suggestions)
- **Resources (ACT):** Curated playbooks, templates, product/service info, and enablement materials. (Knowledge cards, tools, templates)

All department modules must implement these three tabs/sections, ensuring every user can THINK (understand), SEE (get advice), and ACT (take action) in a consistent, empowering way.
