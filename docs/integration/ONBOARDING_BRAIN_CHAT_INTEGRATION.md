# 🧠 Onboarding Brain Chat Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate the onboarding brain system into your chat components to provide personalized, context-aware AI responses. The system transforms onboarding JSON data into rich context that enhances every AI interaction.

## 🎯 What This Achieves

### **Before Integration**
- Generic AI responses without user context
- No knowledge of user's business, goals, or challenges
- One-size-fits-all recommendations
- No personalization based on role or experience level

### **After Integration**
- Personalized responses using your business context
- AI knows your company, industry, goals, and challenges
- Recommendations tailored to your specific situation
- Context-aware suggestions based on your role and experience

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Use the Hook in Chat Components**

```tsx
import { useOnboardingBrainIntegration } from '@/shared/hooks/useOnboardingBrainIntegration';

function ChatComponent() {
  const { 
    brainContext, 
    chatEnhancement, 
    loading, 
    getPersonalizedPrompt 
  } = useOnboardingBrainIntegration();

  const handleSendMessage = async (message: string) => {
    // Get personalized system prompt
    const systemPrompt = await getPersonalizedPrompt('executive');
    
    // Send to AI with enhanced context
    const response = await sendToAI({
      message,
      systemPrompt,
      context: chatEnhancement
    });
  };

  if (loading) return <div>Loading your personalized context...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {brainContext && (
        <div className="context-info">
          <p>Chatting as: {brainContext.userProfile.personal.firstName} ({brainContext.userProfile.personal.role})</p>
          <p>Company: {brainContext.businessContext.industry} - {brainContext.businessContext.size} employees</p>
        </div>
      )}
      {/* Your chat UI */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **2. Enhanced AI Service Integration**

```tsx
import { onboardingBrainIntegration } from '@/shared/services/OnboardingBrainIntegrationService';

class EnhancedAIService {
  async sendMessage(userId: string, message: string, agentType: string = 'executive') {
    // Get personalized context
    const contextResponse = await onboardingBrainIntegration.getOnboardingContext(userId);
    const promptResponse = await onboardingBrainIntegration.getPersonalizedSystemPrompt(userId, agentType);
    
    if (contextResponse.success && promptResponse.success) {
      // Send to AI with rich context
      return await this.callAI({
        message,
        systemPrompt: promptResponse.data,
        userContext: contextResponse.data
      });
    }
    
    // Fallback to basic AI call
    return await this.callAI({ message });
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### **1. Agent-Specific Context**

```tsx
// Different prompts for different AI agents
const executivePrompt = await getPersonalizedPrompt('executive');
const salesPrompt = await getPersonalizedPrompt('sales');
const financePrompt = await getPersonalizedPrompt('finance');
const operationsPrompt = await getPersonalizedPrompt('operations');
```

### **2. Dynamic Context Enhancement**

```tsx
const { enhanceChatContext } = useOnboardingBrainIntegration();

// Enhance with custom base prompt
const enhancedContext = await enhanceChatContext(`
  You are a business consultant helping with strategic planning.
  Focus on actionable insights and measurable outcomes.
`);
```

### **3. Real-time Context Updates**

```tsx
const { refreshBrainContext } = useOnboardingBrainIntegration();

// Refresh context after onboarding updates
const handleOnboardingComplete = async () => {
  await refreshBrainContext();
  // Context is now updated with latest onboarding data
};
```

## 📊 Context Data Structure

### **User Profile Context**
```typescript
{
  personal: {
    firstName: "Von",
    lastName: "Jackson", 
    role: "Founder",
    experience: "intermediate",
    learningStyle: "hands-on",
    decisionAuthority: "full"
  },
  business: {
    companyName: "Marcoby",
    industry: "Technology",
    companySize: "1-10",
    growthStage: "Growth phase"
  },
  goals: {
    primary: ["Improve efficiency", "Automate processes"],
    challenges: ["Time management", "Scaling"]
  }
}
```

### **Enhanced Chat Context**
```typescript
{
  systemPrompt: "You are an executive-level AI assistant...",
  userContext: "User Profile: Von Jackson, Founder at Marcoby...",
  businessContext: "Business Context: Technology industry, 1-10 employees...",
  goalsContext: "Current Goals: Improve efficiency, Automate processes...",
  recommendations: "Recommended Actions: Set up workflow automation..."
}
```

## 🎯 Example AI Responses

### **Before Integration**
```
User: "How can I improve my business efficiency?"
AI: "There are many ways to improve business efficiency. You could start by analyzing your current processes..."
```
