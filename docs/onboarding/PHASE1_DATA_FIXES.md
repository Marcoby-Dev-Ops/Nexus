# Phase 1 Onboarding Data Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Email Collection ❌➡️✅
**Problem:** User profile had placeholder email `"your-email@example.com"`
**Root Cause:** Onboarding form didn't collect email address
**Fix:** 
- Added email field to `CoreIdentityStep` component
- Updated validation schema to require email
- Updated edge function to save email to database
- Fixed existing user email: `von.jackson@marcoby.com`

### 2. Missing Company Record ❌➡️✅
**Problem:** User had organization but no company record in `companies` table
**Root Cause:** Edge function company creation logic wasn't properly triggered
**Fix:**
- Created missing company record for Marcoby
- Linked user profile to company record
- Updated edge function to include `owner_id` in company creation

### 3. Missing Job Title & Phone ❌➡️✅
**Problem:** Onboarding form didn't collect job title or phone number
**Root Cause:** Form was simplified and missing these fields
**Fix:**
- Added job title and phone fields to `CoreIdentityStep`
- Updated validation and data saving logic
- Added to onboarding schema

## Updated Data Collection Flow

### Registration → Onboarding Pipeline
1. **User Registration** (Authentik)
   - Email (primary identifier)
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Company Name

2. **Phase 1 Onboarding** (CoreIdentityStep)
   - ✅ First Name (from registration)
   - ✅ Last Name (from registration)
   - ✅ Email (from registration + validation)
   - ✅ Job Title (new field)
   - ✅ Phone Number (new field)
   - ✅ Company Name (from registration)
   - ✅ Industry
   - ✅ Company Size
   - ✅ Key Priorities

3. **Database Updates**
   - User profile updated with all collected data
   - Company record created and linked
   - Onboarding phase data stored

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields

- Last Name  
- Email (valid email format)

```

### companies table

```
