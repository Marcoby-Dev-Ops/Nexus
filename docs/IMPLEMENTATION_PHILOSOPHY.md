# Implementation Philosophy

Nexus is designed as a reasoning-driven personal assistant, prioritizing actionable intelligence and automation.

## Principles

- **Contextual Reasoning:** Agents interpret user context and intent.
- **Actionable Intelligence:** Nexus acts on information, not just analyzes it.
- **Extensibility:** Built for easy integration of new skills, tools, and channels.
- **Security:** RBAC and secure configuration are core.

## OpenClaw Integration

- Leverages OpenClaw for agent orchestration and channel connectivity.
- Modular design enables rapid extension and adaptation.
