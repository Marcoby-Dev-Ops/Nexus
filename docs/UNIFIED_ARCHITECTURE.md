# Nexus Unified Architecture

This document outlines the unified architecture for the Nexus platform, designed to create a coherent and consistent user experience across all product modules.

## Core Principles

1. **Hub and Spoke Model**: Centralized navigation with context-aware secondary navigation
2. **Consistent UI Patterns**: Standardized templates and patterns across departments
3. **Feature Discovery**: Centralized feature registry for discoverability
4. **Contextual Relevance**: Presenting the right tools at the right time
5. **Visual Consistency**: Cohesive visual language across all modules

## Key Components

### 1. Unified Layout (`UnifiedLayout.tsx`)

The `UnifiedLayout` component serves as the primary layout wrapper for the entire application, implementing the hub and spoke model with:

- Global sidebar navigation (the hub)
- Contextual secondary navigation
- Breadcrumbs for hierarchical navigation
- User profile and context
- Responsive design for all devices

### 2. Workspace Hub (`WorkspacePage.tsx`)

The `WorkspacePage` component serves as the personalized central hub for each user, featuring a dynamic, widget-based dashboard that includes:

- AI-driven insights and proactive alerts
- A comprehensive calendar view
- Task and idea management
- A unified inbox for communications
- Quick access to recent and favorite items

### 3. Feature Registry (`featureRegistry.tsx`)

The feature registry provides a central, structured way to register and discover platform features:

- Categorized feature definitions
- Access control integration
- Search functionality
- Related feature suggestions
- Documentation linking

### 4. Feature Explorer (`FeatureExplorer.tsx`)

The Feature Explorer component helps users discover functionality:

- Browse features by category
- Search for specific features
- Filter by access level
- Pin favorites for quick access
- See recommendations

### 5. Department Template (`DepartmentTemplate.tsx`)

A standardized template for department pages providing consistent layouts:

- Department header with title, description, and actions
- Key metrics display
- Tabbed interface for different views
- Standardized search and filters

### 6. Settings Layout (`SettingsLayout.tsx`)

A consistent layout for all settings pages:

- Sidebar navigation for settings categories
- Visual hierarchy of settings
- Permission-based display
- Section-based organization

### 7. System Configuration (`SystemConfigContext.tsx`)

Centralized configuration management:

- Feature flags
- Environment-specific settings
- Branding configuration
- API endpoints
- Language and localization

### 8. Theme Management (`ThemeContext.tsx`)

Unified theme management across the application:

- Light/dark mode support
- System preference detection
- Persistent user preferences
- Dynamic theme switching

## Implementation Architecture

The architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Providers Layer**: Core context providers for system-wide state
   - `SystemConfigProvider`
   - `ThemeProvider`
   - `EnhancedUserProvider`

2. **Layout Layer**: Structural components for application layout
   - `UnifiedLayout`
   - `DepartmentTemplate`
   - `SettingsLayout`

3. **Feature Layer**: Components that implement business functionality
   - Department pages
   - Settings pages
   - Feature-specific components

4. **UI Component Layer**: Reusable UI components
   - Cards, buttons, inputs, etc.
   - Data display components
   - Form components

## Benefits

This unified architecture provides several benefits:

1. **Improved User Experience**: Consistent interface reduces cognitive load
2. **Higher Productivity**: Related tools are contextually grouped
3. **Better Feature Discovery**: Users can find features more easily
4. **Faster Onboarding**: Consistent patterns are easier to learn
5. **Development Efficiency**: Standardized components speed up development
6. **Maintenance Simplicity**: Common patterns are easier to maintain

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core layout and navigation
   - Unified layout structure
   - Global navigation
   - Workspace hub

2. **Phase 2**: Templates and patterns
   - Department templates
   - Settings layout
   - Common UI patterns

3. **Phase 3**: Feature registry and discovery
   - Feature definitions
   - Feature explorer
   - Search and discovery

4. **Phase 4**: Context providers
   - System configuration
   - Theme management
   - Enhanced user context

5. **Phase 5**: Department implementations
   - Sales department
   - Finance department
   - Operations department
