# Nexus OS — Project Context for Cursor

> **TL;DR:** Nexus OS is a self-hosted, modular business operating system with department-based dashboards, AI assistants, and a Pulse marketplace for instant add-ons. Built as a "Tool as a Skill-Bridge" that enables entrepreneurs to execute their vision without mastering every domain.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: "Tool as a Skill-Bridge"

Nexus transforms from a reporting tool into a **business command center** where users don't just see their business - they can run it. The platform serves as a "skill-bridge" that enables entrepreneurs to execute their vision without mastering every domain.

### The Complete Action Loop
```
Insight → Next Best Action → Execution → Journaled Learning → Sharper Insight
   ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓
"Revenue    "Send follow-   Automated    "This worked    "Optimize for
dropped"    up emails"      execution    → +$15K"        next quarter"
```

*See `/docs/current/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md` for technical mapping of these principles into the architecture.*

### Key Principles:
1. **Clarity First** - Every feature makes it obvious what to do next
2. **Delegation by Design** - Easily hand off tasks to team members or AI agents
3. **Role-Centric Structure** - See business through clear functional units
4. **Integrated Intelligence** - All tools in one hub for context switching
5. **Immediate Value** - 10-minute onboarding with real insights and actionable recommendations
