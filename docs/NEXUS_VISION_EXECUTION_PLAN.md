## How to Use This Document & The Prompt Library

This document outlines the strategic vision and execution roadmap for Nexus. To ensure clarity and consistency in development, each major feature listed in the roadmap is accompanied by a **prompt**. These prompts, sourced from the `NEXUS_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md`, should be used to create detailed tickets or epics in our project management tool.

**For Developers:**
- Each prompt serves as the foundation for a new feature build.
- The **Acceptance Criteria** within each prompt are the "Definition of Done" for that feature.
- All development must adhere to the global instructions on testing, security, and design systems outlined in the prompt library.

**For Project Managers:**
- Copy each prompt and its acceptance criteria into a new ticket/epic.
- Use the phased roadmap to prioritize development efforts.
- Ensure all new work is aligned with the prompts to maintain consistency.

## IIb. Dashboard vs Workspace: Clear Differentiation

Nexus provides two distinct but complementary interfaces to serve different user needs and contexts:

### **Dashboard - Strategic Business Intelligence Hub**
**Purpose**: Executive-level business oversight and strategic decision-making  
**Users**: Executives, managers, business leaders, department heads  
**Scope**: Organization-wide insights and company performance  

**Key Features**:
- **Executive KPIs**: Annual revenue, active users, global markets, system uptime
- **Strategic Metrics**: Company-wide innovation, intelligence, and execution tracking  
- **Business Intelligence**: Cross-departmental insights and strategic activities
- **Executive Actions**: Board reports, department analysis, forecast reviews, risk assessments
- **System Status**: Real-time monitoring of data sources and automations
- **Auto-refresh**: Business data updates every 5 minutes
- **Design**: Professional, corporate aesthetic focused on strategic oversight

### **Workspace - Personal Productivity Command Center**  
**Purpose**: Individual productivity optimization and personal task management  
**Users**: Individual contributors, knowledge workers, anyone focused on personal productivity  
**Scope**: Personal workflows, tasks, and individual performance  

**Key Features**:
- **Personal Metrics**: Tasks completed today, focus time, learning streaks
- **Productivity Tools**: Pomodoro timers, deep work mode, break reminders, mindfulness exercises
- **Individual Workflows**: Task management, idea capture, personal calendar, email management
- **Personal AI Assistant**: Individual productivity optimization and workflow suggestions
- **Wellness Features**: Celebration widgets, productivity tips, motivational elements
- **Learning & Development**: Personal learning feed, skill development tracking
- **Design**: Friendly, motivating aesthetic focused on individual empowerment

### **Key Differentiators**:

| Aspect | Dashboard | Workspace |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope** | Organization-wide | Personal/Individual |
| **Data** | Business metrics & KPIs | Personal tasks & activities |
| **Time Horizon** | Strategic (quarterly/yearly) | Tactical (daily/weekly) |
| **Visual Design** | Executive/corporate aesthetic | Personal/friendly aesthetic |
| **Actions** | Strategic decisions | Personal productivity |
| **Refresh** | Auto-refresh business data | User-initiated personal updates |
| **Access Control** | Role-based for sensitive metrics | Personal data only |
| **Primary Goal** | "What's happening with the business?" | "What do I need to do today?" |

This clear separation ensures users can seamlessly switch between strategic oversight and personal productivity without confusion or feature overlap.

## IIa. Security & Credential Management (Production-Ready Integrations)

To ensure Nexus is enterprise-ready and secure for all OAuth and API key integrations, we will implement a robust, production-grade credential management system:

- **Centralized Credential Manager:**
  - All sensitive credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens) are managed by a dedicated credential manager service.
  - Only encrypted data is stored in the database; no plaintext credentials at rest.
  - All encryption/decryption and sensitive operations are performed backend-side only.

- **Encryption & Key Management:**
  - Use strong encryption (AES-GCM or similar) for all credentials.
  - Encryption keys are never hardcoded or stored in the database; they are managed via environment variables or a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS KMS, GCP KMS).
  - Keys are rotated periodically and never exposed to the frontend or logs.

- **Access Control & Audit Logging:**
  - Only the credential owner (user/org) can access their credentials; all access is strictly checked.
  - Every credential access, creation, update, and revocation is logged in a tamper-resistant audit log table.

- **Rotation, Revocation, and Compliance:**
  - Credentials can be rotated or revoked at any time by users or admins.
  - The system supports compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.) for secure data handling and deletion.

- **Integration Flows:**
  - OAuth and API key flows are fully integrated with the credential manager.
  - The frontend only triggers credential flows; it never handles or sees raw credentials or encryption keys.

- **Testing, Monitoring, and Review:**
  - All credential manager logic is covered by unit and integration tests.
  - Audit logs are monitored for suspicious activity.
  - Regular reviews and key rotation are part of ongoing security operations.

This approach ensures Nexus is secure, compliant, and ready for enterprise integrations at scale.

## IIc. Migration Hygiene & Applied Migration Archiving (Best Practice)

To ensure smooth database migrations and avoid duplicate key errors or migration conflicts, Nexus follows a strict migration hygiene process:

- **Archive Already-Applied Migrations:**
  - After a migration has been successfully applied and is recorded in the `schema_migrations` table, move the corresponding migration file out of the `supabase/migrations/` directory into an archive folder (e.g., `supabase/migrations_applied/`).
  - This prevents the Supabase CLI from attempting to re-apply migrations, which can cause duplicate key errors.

- **Keep Only New/Unapplied Migrations:**
  - Only keep migration files that have not yet been applied in the `supabase/migrations/` directory.

- **Automate the Process:**
  - Use a shell script to move all migration files with `.applied` or known-applied timestamps to the archive folder:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p supabase/migrations_applied && mv supabase/migrations/*applied* supabase/migrations_applied/ 2>/dev/null
    ```
  - For more advanced automation, check the `schema_migrations` table and move only those migrations that are already present.

- **Version Control:**
  - Keep the `migrations_applied` folder in version control for historical reference and auditability.

- **Summary:**
  - This process ensures that only new migrations are applied, prevents migration errors, and keeps the migration history clean and reproducible.

## IX. The Trinity & Data Flywheel

The Trinity is the core, dynamic workflow of Nexus, defining how users interact with the platform to produce outcomes. It is a powerful cycle that makes intelligence actionable.

-   **THINK: The Generative Engine**
    -   This is our creative capability. THINK is used to generate new ideas, strategies, content, and deliverables within Nexus. It's the engine for innovation.
-   **SEE: The Diagnostic Engine**
    -   This is our analytical lens. SEE provides a clear, data-driven understanding of the health of the company, its departments, and its workflows. It's the engine for objective insight.
-   **ACT: The Automation Engine**
    -   This is our operational force. ACT is used to implement the creative ideas from THINK and execute on the factual insights from SEE through powerful, automated workflows. It's the engine for execution.
-   **Continuous Learning:** Every cycle of THINK, SEE, and ACT feeds back into the Nexus Brain, making the entire system smarter, more proactive, and more valuable for all users (the data flywheel).

### Personal & Team Workspace Trinity:
This Trinity is applied at every level:
-   **THINK:** Brainstorm new marketing campaigns, draft project proposals, generate code, or outline a new business strategy.
-   **SEE:** Analyze real-time sales performance, review project velocity, diagnose operational bottlenecks, or assess team engagement metrics.
-   **ACT:** Launch an automated marketing sequence, trigger a project-kickoff workflow, schedule a series of strategic meetings, or deploy a new internal tool.

## X. Next Steps (Immediate Action Board)

1. Focus on Critical Path MVP gaps: UI/UX, department depth, onboarding, admin panel, and theme builder.
2. Turn each "Critical Path" item into an Epic with stories/tickets, assigned and estimated.
3. Ship and demo weekly—show working software, not slides.
4. Implement feedback loop: user feedback → roadmap reprioritization.
5. Document and automate repeatable processes (setup, testing, onboarding).
6. Prepare for early customer pilot and reference customers.

## Universal Department Structure: SEE → THINK → ACT

To maximize clarity, enablement, and action, every department module in Nexus now follows the universal SEE → THINK → ACT workflow:

-   **SEE (Analysis & Diagnosis):** First, understand the current state with automated and on-demand analysis of department performance, trends, and diagnostics (KPIs, charts, summaries). This is where you see the objective reality.
-   **THINK (Strategy & Ideas):** Based on the analysis, use Nexus's generative capabilities to brainstorm solutions, develop strategies, and create new deliverables (AI-powered recommendations, strategic plans, creative content). This is where you decide what to do.
-   **ACT (Execution & Automation):** Finally, put the plan into action. Use curated playbooks, automation workflows, and integrated tools to execute the strategy and achieve the desired outcome (Automated workflows, one-click actions, integrated tools).

This structure ensures:
-   Every user can SEE (diagnose), THINK (strategize), and ACT (execute) in a consistent, empowering way.
-   Cross-departmental work is seamless and intuitive.
-   Continuous learning and improvement are built into daily workflows.
