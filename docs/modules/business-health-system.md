```typescript
// Edge function for real-time KPI data ingestion
interface Datapoint {
  kpi_key: string;
  value: unknown;
  recorded_at?: string;
  source?: string;
}

// Multi-tenant secure ingestion with JWT validation
// Automatic org_id extraction from JWT claims
// Bulk insert capability for high-volume metrics
```

#### **Department KPI Hooks** (`useDepartmentKPIs`)

// React hook for department-specific KPI fetching
// Aggregates revenue metrics over 12-month periods
// Provides monthly breakdown for trend analysis
// Fallback handling for missing data
```

### **Scoring Algorithm**

#### **KPI Score Calculation**
```typescript
export function calculateKPIScore(kpi: KPI, value: number | string | boolean): number {
  // Boolean KPIs: Direct 0/100 scoring
  // Selection KPIs: Proportional scoring based on options
  // Numeric KPIs: Threshold-based scoring with inverse handling
  // Weighted aggregation at category level
}
```

#### **Category & Overall Scoring**
```typescript
// Category Score = Œ£(KPI_Score √ó KPI_Weight) / Œ£(KPI_Weight)
// Overall Score = Œ£(Category_Score √ó Category_Weight) / Œ£(Category_Weight)
```

### **Database Schema**

#### **KPI Snapshots Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_kpi_snapshots (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  org_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  department_id text NOT NULL,
  kpi_key text NOT NULL,
  kpi_id text,
  value jsonb NOT NULL,
  source text DEFAULT 'manual',
  captured_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### **Department Metrics View**
```sql
CREATE VIEW department_metrics_view AS
SELECT 
  department,
  jsonb_build_object(
    'score', calculated_score,
    'updatedAt', now(),
    'kpis', aggregated_kpi_data
  ) as state
FROM kpi_aggregation_logic;
```
