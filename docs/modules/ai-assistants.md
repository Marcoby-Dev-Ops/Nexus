## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: A Technical Breakdown

The advanced capabilities described above are achieved through a sophisticated, interconnected system of specialized components and services. Here's exactly how the codebase accomplishes this, connecting concepts to the code.

### 1. **Hierarchical Agent Architecture: The Core of Specialization**

The three-tier system (Executive ‚Üí Departmental ‚Üí Specialist) is hard-coded into the agent definitions and UI logic, ensuring true specialization.

*   **Agent Definitions (`src/lib/agentRegistry.ts`)**: This file is the heart of the agent hierarchy. Each of the 20+ agents is defined here as an `Agent` object with specific properties that dictate its behavior:
    *   `type`: `'executive'`, `'departmental'`, or `'specialist'`.
    *   `parentId`: Links specialists to their department heads (e.g., `sales-rep`'s parent is `sales-dept`).
    *   `knowledgeBase`: Defines expertise, including tools (`Salesforce`, `SAP`) and frameworks (`MEDDIC`, `Lean Six Sigma`).
    *   `personality`: Determines tone, experience level, and communication style.
    *   `systemPrompt`: A detailed, multi-paragraph directive telling the AI *exactly* how to behave as that specific persona.

*   **UI & Routing Logic (`src/components/ai/OrganizationalChatPanel.tsx` & `DepartmentalAgent.tsx`)**: The UI directly reflects and enables this hierarchy.
    1.  The user starts with the `ModernExecutiveAssistant`.
    2.  The `OrganizationalChatPanel` provides a button to switch to the `DepartmentSelector`.
    3.  When a department is chosen, the `DepartmentalAgent` component is loaded with the correct agent persona from the registry.
    4.  Crucially, the `DepartmentalAgent` component itself can then recommend and switch to a more specialized agent within that department using its `handleSpecialistSwitch` function, achieving the third level of the hierarchy.

### 2. **Advanced AI Capabilities: The Intelligence Engine**

These are not just features but entire subsystems working in concert to provide deep intelligence.

*   **Contextual RAG Intelligence (`src/lib/contextualRAG.ts`)**: This 900+ line file is the system's brain.
    *   **How it works**: When a message is sent, the `enhancedChatService` calls the `ContextualRAG` service. It doesn't just pass the query to an AI. First, it builds a massive, context-rich prompt using methods like `getExecutiveContext` and `getDepartmentContext`.
    *   This prompt is dynamically assembled with the user's profile, business context (from integrations), real-time business intelligence, and personalization insights.
    *   The `analyzeQueryRouting` function uses keyword analysis and strategic pattern matching to decide if the query should be handled by the Executive agent or routed to a specific department, ensuring the right "expert" always answers.

*   **Progressive Intelligence & Second Brain (`src/components/ai/ProgressiveIntelligence.tsx` & `src/lib/hooks/useSecondBrain.ts`)**:
    *   **How it works**: The `ProgressiveIntelligence` component is powered by the `useSecondBrain` hook. This hook connects to **real integration data** from services like Google Analytics, Stripe, and HubSpot.
    *   It calls `generateContextualInsights` to analyze this live data and produce the "Business Insights" you see (e.g., "Website conversion rate is 23% above industry average").
    *   It also calls `generateProgressiveActions` to suggest relevant next steps or automation opportunities based on the current page and live data.

*   **Multi-Modal Processing (`src/lib/nexusAIOrchestrator.ts`)**:
    *   **How it works**: The `NexusAIController` UI allows users to upload documents or record voice. This calls the `processMultiModalInput` method in the `nexusAIOrchestrator`.
    *   The orchestrator sends this data to the appropriate Supabase Edge Function (e.g., `ai_embed_document`), which uses specialized models to process the content, extract data, and store it as vectors for future analysis and retrieval.

### 3. **Enterprise-Grade Features: The Automation & Memory Layer**

This is where the system moves from providing insights to taking autonomous action.

*   **Task Automation Orchestration**:
    *   **How it works**: AI agents have access to a list of `actionTools` defined in `src/lib/aiAgentWithTools.ts`. These are functions the AI can choose to call.
    *   When the AI decides an action is needed (e.g., "create a follow-up sequence"), it executes the corresponding tool.
    *   Many tools, like `send_team_notification`, then call the **`N8nService` (`src/lib/n8nService.ts`)**. This service is the bridge to your n8n instance, triggering complex, multi-step workflows that can interact with dozens of external applications, effectively automating entire business processes.

*   **Personalization & Memory**:
    *   **How it works**: Chat history is not temporary. The `useAIChatStore` (a Zustand store) captures every message.
    *   It uses a persistence layer to save conversations to the `ai_conversations` and `ai_messages` tables in your Supabase database.
    *   This history is then used by the `ContextualRAG` service to understand past interactions and personalize future responses. User preferences, goals, and even communication style are tracked and fed back into the prompts, making the assistant's responses more adaptive and intelligent over time.
