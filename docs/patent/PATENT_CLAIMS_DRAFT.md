## ðŸ“‹ **Primary Claims**

### **Claim 1: Intelligent Business Process Management System**

An intelligent business process management **system**, comprising:

1. **Processor-executed input analysis module configured to**: 
   - (i) tokenize user text input via natural language processing;
   - (ii) apply a large language model-generated embedding to extract semantic features;
   - (iii) calculate sentiment and urgency scores using a pre-trained neural network;
   - (iv) determine an operational phase of a process framework from a set of phases including Focus, Insight, Roadmap, and Execute;

2. **Context classification module configured to**:
   - classify said input as new or existing context based on entity extraction and pattern matching against historical interaction logs stored in non-transitory memory;

3. **Adaptive recommendation engine configured to**:
   - generate phase-specific, context-aware playbook recommendations;
   - wherein the recommendations are regenerated in â‰¤ 500ms when the user's operational phase changes;
   - and, when historical data is unavailable, utilizes a default playbook set ranked by static relevance scores;

4. **Cross-domain overlay system configured to**:
   - present said recommendations via a persistent overlay rendered via a client-application UI component;
   - wherein the overlay stores user session state in a non-transitory memory;
   - and maintains phase-aware agent and automation logic across multiple business domains;

5. **Continuous learning module configured to**:
   - track user interactions and update classification models;
   - wherein the continuous learning module periodically retrains a classification model on interaction logs at a cadence â‰¤ 24 hours;
   - and, when the classification confidence < 0.7, the system applies a deterministic rules engine to select the phase.

### **Claim 2: Computer-Readable Medium**

A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processors to perform the method of claim 1.

### **Claim 3: Multiple-Dependent Claims**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the sentiment analysis further comprises urgency detection using a time-based weighting algorithm.

### **Claim 4: Dynamic Playbook System**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the adaptive recommendation engine:
- (a) calculates confidence scores for each playbook recommendation using a multi-factor model;
- (b) ranks recommendations by relevance to the current operational phase;
- (c) provides fallback recommendations when confidence scores fall below a threshold of 0.6;
- (d) adapts recommendations based on user feedback and interaction patterns.

### **Claim 5: Cross-Domain State Management**

The system of any preceding claim, further comprising:
- a state synchronization module configured to maintain consistent phase information across multiple business domains;
- wherein the state synchronization module updates phase information in real-time across all connected domains;
- and provides rollback capabilities for phase transitions.

### **Claim 6: Executive Coaching Intelligence**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the adaptive recommendation engine further comprises:
- an executive coaching module configured to provide contextual guidance based on historical data and playbook knowledge;
- wherein the coaching module references session history and business context to generate personalized recommendations;
- and adapts coaching style based on user proficiency level and domain expertise.

### **Claim 7: Real-Time Phase Transition**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the input analysis module:
- monitors user input in real-time;
- detects phase transition triggers based on keyword analysis and context changes;
- automatically updates the operational phase when transition confidence exceeds 0.8;
- and provides visual feedback to users during phase transitions.

### **Claim 8: Multi-Modal Input Processing**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the input analysis module is further configured to:
- process text, voice, and structured data inputs;
- apply domain-specific preprocessing for different input types;
- maintain input history for context-aware analysis;
- and provide input validation and error handling.

### **Claim 9: Performance Optimization**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the system further comprises:
- a caching layer configured to store frequently accessed playbooks and recommendations;
- wherein the caching layer reduces response time to â‰¤ 200ms for cached recommendations;
- and implements cache invalidation based on phase changes and user interactions.

### **Claim 10: Security and Privacy**

The system of any preceding claim, wherein the system further comprises:
- an encryption module configured to secure user data and interaction logs;
- wherein all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit;
- and implements role-based access control for different user types.

## ðŸ“‹ **Method Claims (Alternative Implementation)**

### **Claim 11: Computer-Implemented Method**

A computer-implemented **method**, executed by one or more processors, comprising the steps of:

1. **Receiving and analyzing user input** using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to determine an operational phase of a process framework;

2. **Classifying said input** as new or existing context based on entity extraction and pattern matching;

3. **Generating phase-specific, context-aware playbook recommendations** using an adaptive recommendation engine;

4. **Presenting said recommendations** via a persistent overlay rendered via a client-application UI component;

5. **Tracking user interactions** and updating classification models through continuous learning;

wherein the method is performed by a system comprising the components of any one of claims 1-10.

## ðŸ“‹ **Prior Art Contrast Statements**

### **For Patent Specification (Not Claims)**

> "Unlike workflow systems such as Monday.com (US 2021/xxxxx), which apply static rule trees, the present invention employs a probabilistic multi-factor model combining sentiment, entity relevance, and cross-domain correlation to yield adaptive phase-aware recommendations."

> "Unlike traditional project management tools that require manual phase assignment, the present invention automatically classifies user inputs into operational phases using AI-powered analysis, enabling seamless integration of process guidance across all business activities."

> "Unlike existing business process management systems that operate in isolation, the present invention provides a persistent overlay that maintains context and phase awareness across multiple business domains, creating a unified execution environment."
