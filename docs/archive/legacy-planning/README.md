# Legacy Planning Docs Archive

Archived on: 2026-02-11

## Why these were archived

These planning/process documents were no longer reliable for current execution:

- They referenced files that no longer exist (for example `PROGRESS_TRACKING.md`, `MASTER_TODO_LIST.md`, and `analysis/ACCURATE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`).
- They represented a template-driven workflow that is no longer the active source of truth for Nexus.

## Archived files

- `PROGRESS_TRACKING_GUIDE.md`
- `WEEKLY_PROGRESS_TEMPLATE.md`

## Current source of truth

Use `docs/current/ENGINEERING_STATUS.md` for current development cycle status and active focus.
