# Nexus: The Complete Organizational Operating System

## 🎯 Vision Statement
Nexus is the world's first complete organizational operating system that combines **creative intelligence** (brainstorming), **business intelligence** (analytics), and **operational intelligence** (automation) into a unified platform where individual thoughts become organizational action.

---

## 🏗️ Target Architecture Overview (2025)

### Trinity Architecture: SEE / ACT / THINK

- **THINK:** Brainstorm, collaborate, and capture ideas (Personal/Team/Org memory, AI-powered prompts)
- **SEE:** Analyze, understand, and get real-time insights (Dashboards, analytics, AI agents)
- **ACT:** Automate, execute, and optimize (Workflows, automations, integrations)
- **Continuous Learning:** Every action and insight feeds back into the system, making Nexus smarter for all users (data flywheel)

### Modular Boundaries & Structure

- **Domain-Driven:** Each top-level directory in `src/` is a business domain (e.g., `ai/`, `analytics/`, `user/`, `workspace/`, etc.)
- **Subdomains:** Each domain contains its own `components/`, `features/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, and `pages/` subdirectories
- **Shared Code:** Centralized in `src/shared/` for UI, utilities, and logic (no domain-specific logic here)
- **Strict Import Boundaries:** Domains should not import from each other except via shared interfaces/services
- **State Management:** Zustand for UI state, React Query for server state
- **Testing:** Jest, Testing Library, Cypress (E2E)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Codecov
- **Backend:** PostgreSQL with pgvector, Express Edge Functions, Authentik Auth

---

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Router
- **State:** Zustand, React Query
- **Backend:** PostgreSQL with pgvector, Express Edge Functions, Authentik Auth
- **Testing:** Jest, Testing Library, Cypress
- **Build:** Vite, ESLint, TypeScript
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Codecov

---

### Best Practices

- **Modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase**
- **Strict type safety with TypeScript**
- **Responsive, accessible, and mobile-first UI**
- **Error boundaries and logging for all major features**
- **Automated tests and code quality gates**
- **Documentation for all modules and APIs**

### Real-World Example Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Customer Success Innovation
**THINK**: Sarah (Customer Success) has thought: *"We need better onboarding"*
**SEE**: Analytics show 40% drop-off at day 3, $2M annual churn risk
**ACT**: Automatically creates personalized onboarding sequence, schedules follow-ups, notifies team

#### Scenario 2: Sales Optimization
**THINK**: Team brainstorms: *"Focus on enterprise clients"*
**SEE**: CRM data shows enterprise deals 3x higher value, 60% close rate
**ACT**: Auto-updates lead scoring, redirects marketing spend, creates enterprise nurture campaigns

#### Scenario 3: Financial Efficiency
**THINK**: Finance team idea: *"Reduce software costs"*
**SEE**: Analysis reveals $50K/year in unused licenses across departments
**ACT**: Automatically audits usage, cancels unused subscriptions, reallocates budget
