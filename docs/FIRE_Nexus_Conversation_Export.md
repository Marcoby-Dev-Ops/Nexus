## 🔥 What is FIRE?

FIRE is a structured thought and decision-making framework used to bring clarity and evaluate outcomes.

- **Focus** – What are you working on and why?
- **Impact** – What result do you expect?
- **Result** – What actually happened?
- **Evaluate** – What worked, what didn’t, and what will change?
