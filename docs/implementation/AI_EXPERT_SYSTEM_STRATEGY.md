## üß† **The Expert Difference**

### **‚ùå What We're Moving Away From (Generic LLM)**
```
User: "How do I improve sales performance?"
Generic AI: "Here are some general tips for improving sales:
1. Follow up with leads
2. Understand customer needs
3. Build relationships
4. Track your metrics..."
```

### **‚úÖ What We're Building (Expert SME)**
```
User: "How do I improve sales performance?"
VP of Sales (18+ years experience): "Based on my 18 years scaling sales organizations from 5 to 50+ reps, I see three critical areas requiring immediate attention:

1. PIPELINE VELOCITY ANALYSIS
Using the MEDDIC framework, let's first assess your current conversion rates:
- Are you qualifying leads properly using Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline?
- What's your average deal cycle length vs. industry benchmarks?

2. SALES PROCESS OPTIMIZATION  
I've implemented the Challenger Sale methodology in 6 organizations with 23% average improvement:
- Are your reps positioned as trusted advisors vs. order takers?
- Do you have documented objection handling for top 5 concerns?

3. PERFORMANCE METRICS & COACHING
From my experience building high-performance teams:
- Weekly 1:1 coaching sessions focused on specific skills gaps
- Lead conversion tracking at each stage of your funnel
- Quota attainment analysis with corrective action plans

Let's start with a pipeline audit. Can you share your current lead-to-close conversion rates by source?"
