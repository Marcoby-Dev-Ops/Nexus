- Sales pipeline ($1.85M pipeline, 87% quota attainment, top deals)
- Marketing performance (campaigns, leads, website analytics)
- Operational status (projects, team capacity, support tickets)
- Key business ratios (CAC, LTV, burn rate, gross margin)

**Coverage Level: ~60% of essential company baseline**

### âœ… **User Baseline - What We Have**

**Individual Context:**
- Profile data (role, department, permissions, preferences)
- Activity patterns (session duration, recent pages, frequent actions)
- Interaction history (conversations, agent usage, topics)
