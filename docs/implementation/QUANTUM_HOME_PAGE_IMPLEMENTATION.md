# Quantum Home Page Implementation

## üéØ Overview

The **Quantum Home Dashboard** (`src/components/dashboard/QuantumHomeDashboard.tsx`) is the main home page that reflects the **Quantum Business Model** framework. It showcases the 7 irreducible building blocks as the core of Nexus's approach to business management.

## üè† **How the Home Page Reflects the Framework**

### **1. Hero Section - Framework Introduction**
```
"Your Business, Quantum Perspective"
"Every business is composed of 7 fundamental building blocks. 
Nexus maps yours, measures their health, and helps you strengthen each one."
```

**Purpose**: Immediately introduces users to the quantum framework and sets expectations.

### **2. Business Health Overview - Framework Metrics**
- **Overall Health Score**: Aggregate health across all 7 blocks
- **Blocks Configured**: Shows progress (e.g., "3/7" blocks set up)
- **AI Capabilities Available**: Total AI agents across all blocks
- **Maturity Level**: Business stage based on quantum health

**Purpose**: Provides a high-level view of business health through the quantum lens.

### **3. 7 Quantum Building Blocks Grid - Core Framework**
Each block is displayed as an interactive card showing:

#### **For Configured Blocks:**
- **Strength & Health Metrics**: Dual assessment (0-100%)
- **AI Capabilities Preview**: Available AI agents for that block
- **Quick Actions**: "View Details" and "Strengthen" buttons
- **Category Badge**: nucleus, energy, carriers, memory, connections

#### **For Unconfigured Blocks:**
- **Setup Call-to-Action**: "Set Up [Block Name]"
- **Description**: What the block represents
- **Placeholder State**: Muted styling until configured

**Purpose**: Visual representation of the quantum framework with actionable insights.

### **4. Insights & Recommendations - Framework Intelligence**
- **Key Insights**: AI-generated insights about business health
- **Recommended Actions**: Prioritized steps to strengthen blocks
- **Block-Aware Context**: Each insight/recommendation ties to specific blocks

**Purpose**: Shows how the quantum framework generates actionable intelligence.

### **5. Call-to-Action - Framework Onboarding**
For users without quantum profiles:
- **"Ready to Map Your Business?"** section
- **"Start Quantum Setup"** button
- **Framework Explanation**: Why the 7-block approach matters

**Purpose**: Guides users into the quantum onboarding flow.

## üé® **Visual Design Principles**

### **Block-Centric Layout**
- **Grid Structure**: 7 blocks prominently displayed
- **Card-Based Design**: Each block gets equal visual weight
- **Interactive Elements**: Click to select, hover effects
- **Color Coding**: Health (green/yellow/red), Strength (blue/orange/gray)

### **Framework Hierarchy**
1. **Hero**: Framework introduction
2. **Overview**: High-level metrics
3. **Blocks**: Core framework visualization
4. **Insights**: Framework intelligence
5. **Actions**: Framework-driven next steps

### **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile**: Single column, scrollable
- **Tablet**: 2-3 columns
- **Desktop**: 4 columns for optimal block visibility

## üîÑ **User Journey Integration**

### **New Users (No Quantum Profile)**
1. **Landing**: See the 7 blocks as empty cards
2. **Understanding**: Learn what each block represents
3. **Motivation**: "Start Quantum Setup" call-to-action
4. **Onboarding**: Guided through quantum setup flow

### **Existing Users (With Quantum Profile)**
1. **Overview**: See overall health and maturity
2. **Block Status**: Check individual block health/strength
3. **Insights**: Review AI-generated recommendations
4. **Actions**: Take steps to strengthen weak blocks
