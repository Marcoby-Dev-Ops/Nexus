## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Configuration (`src/core/config/quantumBusinessModel.ts`)

```typescript
export interface QuantumBlock {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>;
  category: 'nucleus' | 'energy' | 'carriers' | 'memory' | 'connections';
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  properties: QuantumProperty[];
  relationships: QuantumRelationship[];
  healthIndicators: HealthIndicator[];
  aiCapabilities: AICapability[];
  marketplaceIntegrations: MarketplaceIntegration[];
  universal: boolean;
}
```

### Database Schema (`server/migrations/035_create_quantum_business_profiles.sql`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE quantum_business_profiles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    company_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    profile_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    health_score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (health_score >= 0 AND health_score <= 100),
    maturity_level TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (maturity_level IN ('startup', 'growing', 'scaling', 'mature')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Service Layer (`src/services/QuantumBusinessService.ts`)

The `QuantumBusinessService` provides methods for:
- Saving and retrieving quantum business profiles
- Generating insights and recommendations
- Deploying AI agents for specific blocks
- Calculating business health scores
- Assessing business maturity levels

## üöÄ Onboarding Flow

### Quantum Onboarding Flow (`src/components/onboarding/QuantumOnboardingFlow.tsx`)

The quantum onboarding flow guides users through:

1. **Introduction**: Explains the quantum approach and shows all 7 blocks
2. **Block Configuration**: For each block, users configure:
   - Key properties (company name, revenue model, etc.)
   - Current strength (1-100%)
   - Current health (1-100%)
3. **Summary**: Shows business health overview, insights, and recommendations

### Key Features

- **Universal Schema**: Works for any business type or size
- **Strength & Health Assessment**: Dual metrics for comprehensive evaluation
- **AI Capability Preview**: Shows available AI agents for each block
- **Real-time Insights**: Generates actionable insights based on configuration
- **Recommendations**: Provides prioritized next steps

## üìä Business Intelligence

### Health Scoring

Each quantum block contributes to the overall business health score:

```typescript
export function calculateBusinessHealth(profile: QuantumBusinessProfile): number {
  const totalHealth = profile.blocks.reduce((sum, block) => sum + block.health, 0);
  return Math.round(totalHealth / profile.blocks.length);
}
```

### Maturity Levels

Based on health score:
- **Startup** (0-49%): Focus on fundamentals
- **Growing** (50-69%): Establish core processes
- **Scaling** (70-84%): Build scalable systems
- **Mature** (85-100%): Optimize and expand

### Insights Generation

The system automatically generates insights based on:
- **Risks**: Blocks with health < 70%
- **Opportunities**: Blocks with strength < 60%
- **Optimization**: Areas for improvement

### Recommendations

AI-powered recommendations include:
- **AI Agent Deployment**: Specific agents for weak blocks
- **Marketplace Integrations**: Tools to strengthen areas
- **Process Improvements**: Actionable steps
- **Capability Building**: Development priorities

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Systems
