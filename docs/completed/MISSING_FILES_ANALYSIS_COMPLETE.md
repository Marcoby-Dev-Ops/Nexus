### **🔧 Current Issues (Not Missing Files)**

#### **1. Import Pattern Issues:**
- ❌ Some files still use old `@/domains/` pattern instead of `@domain/`
- ❌ Some files use `@/admin` instead of `@admin/`
- ❌ Path aliases need to be updated in imports

#### **2. Barrel Export Issues:**
- ❌ Some barrel exports reference non-existent subdirectories
- ❌ Some exports use wrong export names

#### **3. TypeScript Configuration:**
- ❌ Path aliases configured but imports not updated
- ❌ Some imports still reference old file locations

### **📋 Files That Need Import Updates (Not Missing)**

The following files need their imports updated to use the new patterns:

1. **ConsolidatedDashboard.tsx** - Updated ✅
2. **Other dashboard components** - Need similar updates
3. **Analytics components** - Need import pattern updates
4. **Admin components** - Need import pattern updates

### **🎯 What's NOT Missing**

#### **✅ All Required Files Present:**
- ✅ **AuthContext.tsx** - Present in `admin/user/hooks/`
- ✅ **All analytics components** - Present in `analytics/components/`
- ✅ **All dashboard components** - Present in `dashboard/components/`
- ✅ **All services** - Present in their respective `services/` directories
- ✅ **All hooks** - Present in their respective `hooks/` directories
- ✅ **All types** - Present in their respective `types/` directories

#### **✅ All Core Infrastructure Present:**

### **🚀 Next Steps (Not Missing Files)**

1. **Update Import Patterns**: Change all `@/domains/` to `@domain/`
2. **Update Barrel Exports**: Fix any incorrect export references
3. **Test Compilation**: Ensure all imports work correctly
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect new import patterns

### **✅ Conclusion**

**No files are missing!** All required files are present in the codebase. The current issues are:

1. **Import pattern updates needed** (not missing files)
2. **Barrel export fixes needed** (not missing files)
3. **TypeScript configuration updates** (not missing files)

The codebase is **complete and well-organized** - we just need to update the import patterns to use the new domain-driven structure.
