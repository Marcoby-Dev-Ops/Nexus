## 🧠 **Mental Models Integration with FIRE Cycle**

### **Focus Phase: Success Pattern Recognition**

**When users express goals, Nexus applies mental models to find proven examples:**

```typescript
interface FocusPhaseMentalModels {
  // User: "I want to improve our sales process"
  successPatternRecognition: {
    identifySimilarProblems: (userGoal: string) => {
      problemCategory: "sales optimization";
      similarOrganizations: ["HubSpot", "Salesforce", "Pipedrive"];
      successPatterns: ["automated follow-up", "lead scoring", "pipeline management"];
      adaptationStrategy: "Start with automated follow-up (lowest risk, highest impact)";
    };
    
    generateStudyPlan: (targetPattern: Pattern) => {
      researchTasks: ["Analyze HubSpot's follow-up sequences", "Study Salesforce's lead scoring"];
      implementationSteps: ["Build basic automation", "Add lead scoring", "Optimize pipeline"];
      successMetrics: ["Response rate", "Conversion rate", "Sales cycle length"];
    };
  };
}
```

### **Insight Phase: Risk Minimization + Circle of Competence**

**When users gain understanding, Nexus applies risk management principles:**

```typescript
interface InsightPhaseMentalModels {
  // User: "I think we should focus on mobile users"
  riskMinimization: {
    evaluateRiskProfile: (userInsight: string) => {
      currentRisk: "medium"; // Mobile development requires resources
      riskMitigation: "Start with responsive web design (lower risk)";
      validationApproach: "A/B test mobile vs desktop conversion rates";
      fallbackPlan: "If mobile underperforms, optimize desktop experience";
    };
  };
  
  circleOfCompetence: {
    assessCapabilities: (userInsight: string) => {
      currentStrengths: ["web development", "user research"];
      gaps: ["mobile app development", "mobile UX design"];
      recommendedApproach: "Partner with mobile expert or use no-code tools";
      learningPath: ["Study mobile UX patterns", "Test with mobile-first tools"];
    };
  };
}
```

### **Roadmap Phase: Time Allocation + Low-Hanging Fruit**

interface RoadmapPhaseMentalModels {
  // User: "I plan to launch the mobile app next month"
  timeAllocation: {
    create168HourWeek: (userPlan: string) => {
      currentTimeUsage: {
        dayJob: "40 hours/week";
        family: "20 hours/week";
        sleep: "56 hours/week";
        availableForBusiness: "52 hours/week";
      };
      
      optimalAllocation: {
        mobileDevelopment: "20 hours/week";
        userResearch: "10 hours/week";
        marketing: "10 hours/week";
        learning: "12 hours/week";
      };
      
      implementationStrategy: "Use weekends for development, evenings for research";
    };
  };
  
  lowHangingFruit: {
    identifyQuickWins: (userPlan: string) => {
      highImpactLowEffort: [
        "Optimize existing website for mobile",
        "Set up mobile analytics",

      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### **Execute Phase: Skin in the Game + Givers vs Takers**

**When users take action, Nexus applies execution principles:**

```typescript
interface ExecutePhaseMentalModels {
  // User: "I'm starting the mobile development today"
  skinInTheGame: {
    createAccountability: (userAction: string) => {
      personalInvestment: "Commit 20 hours/week for 3 months";
      measurableOutcomes: ["Mobile conversion rate", "User engagement"];
      consequenceFramework: "If goals not met, pivot to web optimization";
      successRewards: "Increased revenue, market expansion";
    };
  };
  
  giversVsTakers: {
    evaluateApproach: (userAction: string) => {
      giverBehaviors: [
        "Focus on user value first",
        "Build relationships with mobile experts",
        "Share learnings with team"
      ];
      
      takerBehaviors: [
        "Rush to market without user feedback",
        "Copy competitors without adding value",
        "Focus only on revenue without user benefit"
      ];
      
      recommendedApproach: "Adopt giver mindset - focus on user value";
    };
  };
}
```

## 🏗️ **Building Blocks Integration with Mental Models**

### **Modular Component Architecture Driven by Mental Models**

#### **1. Success Pattern Recognition → Component Selection**

```typescript
interface ComponentSelectionByMentalModels {
  // When user wants to "follow example of successful sales orgs"
  successPatternRecognition: {
    identifyRelevantComponents: (pattern: SuccessPattern) => {
      salesAutomation: "Follow HubSpot's pattern → SalesAutomationBlock";
      leadScoring: "Follow Salesforce's pattern → LeadScoringBlock";
      pipelineManagement: "Follow Pipedrive's pattern → PipelineBlock";
      
      componentPriority: [
        "SalesAutomationBlock", // Lowest risk, highest impact
        "LeadScoringBlock",     // Medium risk, high impact  
        "PipelineBlock"         // Higher risk, medium impact
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

#### **2. Risk Minimization → Component Architecture**

```typescript
interface RiskMinimizedArchitecture {
  // Build components that minimize risk while maximizing upside
  riskMinimization: {
    componentDesign: {
      modularity: "Each component can be replaced independently";
      fallbackOptions: "If one component fails, others continue working";
      gradualImplementation: "Start with core components, add advanced features later";
      testingStrategy: "Each component has isolated tests and can be validated independently";
    };
    
    implementationApproach: {
      phase1: ["CoreSalesBlock", "BasicAutomationBlock"]; // Low risk
      phase2: ["AdvancedScoringBlock", "IntegrationBlock"]; // Medium risk
      phase3: ["AIBlock", "PredictiveBlock"]; // Higher risk, higher reward
    };
  };
}
```

#### **3. Time Allocation → Component Complexity**

```typescript
interface TimeOptimizedComponents {
  // Design components that fit into 168-hour week
  timeAllocation: {
    componentComplexity: {
      simpleComponents: "Can be implemented in 1-2 hours"; // Evenings
      mediumComponents: "Can be implemented in 4-8 hours"; // Weekends
      complexComponents: "Require dedicated time blocks"; // Vacation days
    };
    
    implementationSchedule: {
      week1: ["SetupBlock", "BasicConfigBlock"]; // 2 hours total
      week2: ["AutomationBlock", "MetricsBlock"]; // 8 hours total
      week3: ["IntegrationBlock", "AdvancedBlock"]; // 16 hours total
    };
  };
}
```
