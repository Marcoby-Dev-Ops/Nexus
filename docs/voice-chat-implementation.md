# Voice Chat Implementation

## Overview

The voice chat functionality in the StreamingComposer has been implemented using the Web Speech API for real-time speech-to-text conversion. This replaces the previous mock implementation with actual working voice recognition.

## Features

- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Uses the Web Speech API for live transcription
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in Chrome, Edge, and Safari (WebKit browsers)
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows listening state and live transcript
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
- **Permission Management**: Handles microphone permissions properly

## How It Works

### 1. Speech Service (`SpeechService.ts`)
- Manages Web Speech API initialization
- Handles browser compatibility checks
- Provides clean interface for recording operations

### 2. StreamingComposer Integration
- Replaces mock implementation with real speech recognition
- Shows live transcript while recording
- Provides visual feedback for recording state
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. User Experience
- Click microphone button to start recording
- Speak naturally - see live transcription
- Click again to stop and send the transcribed text
- Clear error messages for unsupported browsers

## Browser Support

- ✅ **Chrome** (v25+)
- ✅ **Edge** (v79+)
- ✅ **Safari** (v14.1+)
- ❌ **Firefox** (not supported by Web Speech API)

## Technical Implementation

### Speech Service
```typescript
// Check browser support
speechService.isBrowserSupported()

// Start recording
const result = await speechService.startRecording()

// Stop recording
const result = await speechService.stopRecording()
```

### Event Handling
- `onresult`: Handles live transcription updates
- `onerror`: Handles recognition errors
- `onend`: Handles recording completion

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Speech-to-Text**: Integrate with OpenAI Whisper API for better accuracy
2. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages
3. **Noise Cancellation**: Implement client-side noise reduction
4. **Offline Support**: Add offline speech recognition capabilities

## Testing

Run the voice chat tests:
```bash
npm test -- VoiceChat.test.tsx
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Speech recognition not supported"**
   - Use a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for microphone access)

2. **"Failed to start recording"**
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure microphone is not in use by another application

3. **Poor transcription quality**
   - Speak clearly and at normal volume
   - Reduce background noise
   - Consider using a better microphone

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```typescript
console.log('Speech recognition status:', speechService.isBrowserSupported());
```

## Security Considerations

- Microphone access requires user permission
- Audio is processed locally (no cloud transmission)
- No audio data is stored or transmitted
- HTTPS required for microphone access in production
