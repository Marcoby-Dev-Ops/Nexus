# ðŸš€ Nexus â€” Final 2025â€¯Q3 Architecture Snapshot

| Layer                     | What Lives Here                                           | Key Highlights                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Domain Layer**     | `src/core/**` â€“ value objects, aggregates, CQRS/events    | *Money*, *Identity*, *AggregateRoot* enforce invariants; `EventBus` wires domain events to application services. Event replay supported. |
| **Application Services**  | `src/services/**`                                         | Thin orchestration around aggregates + external APIs; all DB access will move through repositories.                                     |
| **Feature Domains**       | `src/pages/**` + twin `src/services/**` folders           | 9 live domains (AI, Analytics, Automation, Business, Dashboard, Integrations, Navigator, Helpâ€‘Center, Auth). Zero pageâ€‘toâ€‘page imports. |
| **Shared Layer**          | `src/shared/**`                                           | Design system (Tailwindâ€¯+â€¯shadcn/ui), hooks (Realtime, RBAC), Zustand stores, utilities.                                                |
| **Realtime & Automation** | Supabase Realtime channels, n8n workflows, Edgeâ€¯Functions | `ai_kpi_snapshots`, `workflow_executions` push live deltas â†’ Navigator; n8n selfâ€‘hosted with webhook queue + retry.                     |
| **Knowledge Vault**       | Supabase StorageÂ +Â pgvector                               | `embed_document` Edge fn chunks & embeds; hybrid vectorâ€¯+â€¯FTS search via `vector_facts`. Deep-linkable chunks, resumable uploads.       |
| **Security**              | RBAC guard â†’ Supabase RLS                                 | Roles (Admin, Owner, Manager, User, Readâ€‘only); permission sets table for custom roles; helper `company_id()` in RLS policies.          |
| **Devâ€‘Tooling**           | `@marcoby/devtools` CLI, Husky, CI                        | Validate, fix, scaffold, docs, permissionâ€‘audit, import-graph. Jest 90â€¯% threshold; Storybook a11y with axeâ€‘core; coverage to Slack.    |

## ðŸ”‘ Architectural Principles

1. **Featureâ€‘based folders, shared centerâ€‘ofâ€‘gravity.**
   All UI, logic, and tests live with their feature; crossâ€‘feature talk happens only through `/shared` or service contracts.

2. **Eventâ€‘driven & realtimeâ€‘native.**
   Domain events publish to `EventBus` â†’ Edgeâ€¯Functions â†’ UI. Navigator, dashboards, and alerts stay live without polling.

3. **DDD purity (pragmatic).**
   Aggregates own rules, services orchestrate, repositories shield DB. Event replay and audit built-in.

4. **Security-first.**
   RBAC enforced at API and DB layers; permission sets enable custom roles; RLS policies use concise helpers.

5. **Dev experience.**
   CLI tools, CI checks, and Storybook a11y keep codebase healthy and onboarding fast.
