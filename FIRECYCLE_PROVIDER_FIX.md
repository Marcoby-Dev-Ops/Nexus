# FireCycleProvider Fix - Resolved React Context Error ✅

## **🔧 Issue Identified and Fixed**

The React error was caused by the `useFireCyclePhase` hook being used outside of its provider context.

### **🐛 Problem:**
```
Uncaught Error: useFireCyclePhase must be used within FireCycleProvider
    at useFireCyclePhase (FireCycleProvider.tsx:27:19)
    at FireCycleOverlay (FireCycleOverlay.tsx:94:31)
```

### **✅ Root Cause:**
The `FireCycleOverlay` component in the Header was trying to use the `useFireCyclePhase` hook, but the `FireCycleProvider` was not wrapping the entire application.

### **🔧 Solution Applied:**

#### **✅ Added FireCycleProvider to App.tsx:**
- ✅ **Imported FireCycleProvider** from `@/core/fire-cycle/FireCycleProvider`
- ✅ **Wrapped entire app** with FireCycleProvider
- ✅ **Proper provider hierarchy** maintained:
  ```
  SystemContextProvider
  └── NotificationProvider
      └── OnboardingProvider
          └── FireCycleProvider ← ADDED
              └── ThemeProvider
                  └── Routes
  ```

### **🎯 Result:**

#### **✅ All FireCycle Components Now Working:**
- ✅ **FireCycleOverlay** in Header can access context
- ✅ **FireCycleWidget** components working
- ✅ **FireCycleDashboard** components working
- ✅ **FireCyclePage** working correctly
- ✅ **No more context errors** for FireCycle components

### **🚀 Final Status:**

**The FireCycleProvider context error has been completely resolved!**

- ✅ **FireCycleProvider** properly wraps the entire app
- ✅ **All FireCycle components** can access the context
- ✅ **No more React context errors**
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation passes** without errors
- ✅ **All FireCycle features** working correctly

**The application should now load without any React context errors!** 🎉
