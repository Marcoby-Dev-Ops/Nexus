### **Empty Directories Removed**
- âœ… `src/components/` - Removed after moving BackendHealthMonitor
- âœ… `src/types/` - Removed after moving supabase.ts

### **Barrel Exports Updated**
- âœ… `src/domains/admin/index.ts` - Added moved services and components
- âœ… `src/domains/analytics/index.ts` - Added moved services
- âœ… `src/domains/dashboard/index.ts` - Added moved services
- âœ… `src/domains/business/index.ts` - Added moved services
- âœ… `src/domains/ai/index.ts` - Added moved services
- âœ… `src/domains/integrations/index.ts` - Added moved services

## **Remaining Core Services**

The following services remain in `src/core/services/` as they are truly core/global services:

- `dataService.ts` - Core data access service
- `supabaseDebugService.ts` - Core debugging service
- `realTimeCrossDepartmentalSync.ts` - Core real-time sync service

## **Migration Benefits**

1. **Better Organization**: Services are now co-located with their related domains
2. **Cleaner Imports**: Can now use domain-specific imports like `@/admin/services/billingService`
3. **Reduced Coupling**: Domain-specific services are isolated within their domains
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify domain-specific functionality

## **Next Steps**

1. **Update Import References**: Update any remaining imports that reference the old locations
2. **Test Functionality**: Ensure all moved services work correctly in their new locations
3. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation that references the old file locations
4. **Clean Up References**: Remove any remaining references to `@/domains/services/` and `@/domains/hooks/`

## **Import Patterns to Update**

### **Before (Old Pattern)**
```typescript
import { billingService } from '@/core/services/billingService';
import { analyticsService } from '@/core/services/analyticsService';
import { BackendHealthMonitor } from '@/components/BackendHealthMonitor';
```

### **After (New Pattern)**
```typescript
import { billingService } from '@/admin/services/billingService';
import { analyticsService } from '@/analytics/services/analyticsService';
import { BackendHealthMonitor } from '@/admin/components/BackendHealthMonitor';
```

## **Files That May Need Import Updates**

The following files may need their imports updated to reflect the new locations:

- Files importing `billingService` from `@/core/services/`
- Files importing `analyticsService` from `@/core/services/`
- Files importing `dashboardService` from `@/core/services/`
- Files importing `companyStatusService` from `@/core/services/`
- Files importing `userService` from `@/core/services/`
- Files importing `BackendHealthMonitor` from `@/components/`

## **Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰**

All orphaned files have been successfully moved to their proper domains, and the barrel exports have been updated accordingly. The codebase is now better organized with domain-specific services co-located with their related functionality.
