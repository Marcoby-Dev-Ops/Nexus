# ðŸ§  Knowledge Domain (Nexus Thoughts)

## Overview
The Knowledge domain powers the Nexus Thoughts systemâ€”an AI-driven, context-aware platform for capturing, developing, and acting on ideas, goals, and learnings. It is foundational to the Nexus experience, enabling users to:
- Identify and set quantitative goals
- Develop and track action plans (tasks, updates)
- Evaluate results and update organizational knowledge
- Receive actionable, context-driven advice from LLMs/AI

## Core Capabilities
- **Thought Management:** Capture ideas, tasks, reminders, and updates. Visualize their lifecycle and relationships.
- **Workflow & Lifecycle:** Progress thoughts through stages (idea â†’ task â†’ update â†’ achievement). Auto-spawn tasks/reminders from ideas.
- **AI/LLM Integration:** Get real-time insights, suggestions, and next steps based on your context and goals.
- **Quantitative Focus:** Every goal and action is tied to a metric or KPI. Progress and results are tracked and visualized.
- **Knowledge Evolution:** Document learnings, update best practices, and inform future analytics and forecasts.
- **Multi-modal Input:** Capture thoughts via text, voice, file upload, or clipboard.
- **Interactive UI:** Use the Home page as your command centerâ€”SEE (metrics), THINK (insights), ACT (actions), and manage THOUGHTS in one place.

## Philosophy
