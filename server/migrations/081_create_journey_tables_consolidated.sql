-- Migration: Create Journey Tables (Consolidated) - UPDATED
-- This migration creates the unified journey system tables
-- Note: Legacy journey_templates, journey_items, user_journey_progress, user_journey_responses 
-- are handled by the unified playbook system in migration 088

-- This migration is now a placeholder since the unified system is created in migration 088
-- The redundant tables that were originally created here have been moved to migration 103 for removal

-- Migration 081 is kept for historical reference but no longer creates redundant tables

-- Default data insertion has been moved to migration 088 (unified playbook system)
-- This migration now serves as a historical placeholder only
