This is closest to the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; pre-LLM assistant architectures. For example, you might have a LLM that strictly does intent extraction, which then feeds that into a more traditional task handling component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are pluses and minuses to either approach, but suffice it to say none have gotten good enough results to be a slam dunk. The &amp;quot;router LLM&amp;quot; approach has gained a lot of buzz recently but it creates a few major issues:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your router LLM still has pretty major scaling issues, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if there&amp;#39;s semantic overlap between subagents (if you have a &amp;quot;music subagent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;movie subagent&amp;quot; and ask it to play JLo... what happens?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failures get &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; in the case of picking the wrong subagent. If you say &amp;quot;reschedule my next meeting&amp;quot; and the request winds up in the &amp;quot;music subagent&amp;quot;, the results are... very bad, with low recoverability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It potentially creates visible seams in the product where if you&amp;#39;re talking to one subagent and want to do something else, the routing makes it difficult to get out of the &amp;quot;mode&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1nw8k5o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AI_Agents/comments/1nw8k5o/tons_of_ai_personal_assistants_being_built_why/nhg7usc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1759446034.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1759446034.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AI_Agents", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "nhfy8au", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "phatinc", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1759442780.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_nhe999g", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4axzt", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Would you say using a fine-tuned tool or specific LLM for each stage of a process or for different purpose be a viable option?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_nhfy8au", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you say using a fine-tuned tool or specific LLM for each stage of a process or for different purpose be a viable option?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1nw8k5o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AI_Agents/comments/1nw8k5o/tons_of_ai_personal_assistants_being_built_why/nhfy8au/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1759442780.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AI_Agents", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_8b5cvj", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AI_Agents", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "nhgojos", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sillenger", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1759451868.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_nhe999g", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_1j933w79ni", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Nice.
